# array-shift

Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and a value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency

I start with create a function that accept two parameters (array,value) then calculate the midpoint for the array
after that I sum the first half of the array with the value then sum the second half of it.
the Big O for this is constant
